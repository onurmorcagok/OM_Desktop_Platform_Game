# OM_Desktop_Platform_Game
 It is a desktop platform game where I have developed one-to-one similar to AA's popular games of the period. Purpose of the application: OM game has a rotating circle in the center and the aim is to fill the circle with black balls of the given number. There are no time limits or right to life in the game, you can try as many times as you want. However, if a ball touches another ball, the game will end and you will have to start the game again. You must fill the gaps in the circle using the balls from the bottom and move on to the other sections. If you are careful in the game you will pass the sections easier. You can fill the gaps more often and get more gaps by tapping the game screen quickly.
